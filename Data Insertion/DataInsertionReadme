In this script I am Inserting the data after reading it from @Json Object which can be changed. 
I am using OPENJSON in from clause to rad the data.

1) I am inserting distinct data in religion table seperately keeping it as my aster table.
2) Then I am inserting User attributes i.e. age, height, pokemon etc. and keeping religion id as foreign key to keep corresponding 
religions.
3) After that I am inserting data in UserAddress, main motive of creating different table is assuming 1 user 
can have multiple addresses but only 1 can be active. Also in this table I am only inserting lat and lon for every user in user table. 
For now Isactive will get set for only 1 address per user by calculating the rownmber.
4) After inserting data in UserAddress table I am again updating the same table to calculate geographical location on 
the basis of lat and lon. This geographical location will help me to calculate the distance between 2 users while generating match.
Same this table is having UserId as its foreign key.
5) Also I am inserting Users pictures in different table with multiple pictures per user but only 1 picture will be main. 
So i have created UserMedia table with Photourl and a bit column IsActive.

This data insertion script is made to handle below cases:

1) Script will not duplicate record even if executed more than 1 time, except UserMedia table.
2) User will not get inserted if ReligionName present in Json is not present in Religion table.
3) UserAddress will not get inserted if the username present in Json is not present in User table.



NOTE: 
According to the data provided I am assuming user attributes collectively i.e. UserName,UserAge,title and height are unique. 
So no user with same value in these attributes will not get inserted
