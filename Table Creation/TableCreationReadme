I am assuming the above provided Json object is the Json for the User related data. Also this Json object is responsible for NewUsers only, so I am not handling any update user details case.
Below Script is handling Insertion cases
So I am creating below tables i.e.

	1) [dbo].[Religion] --> Its the master table for storing the religions. So I am searching the json object and fetching DISTINCT religions and Inserting it in the table. 
							 Also if the above same Json object is modified by adding new user with new Religion type. Below written Insertion script for Religion is handling this case also.
	2) [dbo].[Users]  -->  Its the master table for Users with some of the columns i.e. UserName,Age,JobTitle,Height_cms,PokemonCatchRate,CatsOwned,IsCatLoving,ReligionID(Primary key from [Religion] table)
	3) [dbo].[UserAddress] --> Its the linkage table of user and its address, assuming single user is having multiple address. Also there is one bit column IsActive, which will state 1 active adress per user.
							   Also there is one calculated column UserGeo geography column, which is being calculated the geographical value based on lat and lon.
	4) [dbo].[UserMedia] --> Its the linkage table of user and its images, assuming single user is having multiple address.
							 Also there is one bit column IsMain, which will state 1 main profile picture per user.
	5) [dbo].[MatchedUsers] --> Its the table where generate_matches stored procedure will populate the matches periodically.
